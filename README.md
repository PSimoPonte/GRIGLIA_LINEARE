# GRIGLIA_LINEARE
Creation of a linear and a square grid inside a gridpane

This project was done with Netbeans and the grids contain cells of equal size. The buttons at the bottom of the window allow the creation and insertion of blue dots.
The "random" key creates the dots in random order in the linear grid.
The linear button allows you to represent the dots in the diagonal of the square grid
